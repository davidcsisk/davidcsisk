Welcome to my main Github page.  I'm Dave Sisk, and I've been a data and database professional for over 20 years now, historically focused on data warehousing and database infrastructure. In mid-2022, I completed a Master's degree in Data Science, and have proceeded to pivot my focus toward vector search, Generative AI, and other topics in the realm of analytics, data science, machine learning, and AI. Technologies I really enjoy working with include Databricks, Snowflake, JupyterLab, Python, SciKit-Learn, Pandas, PySpark, SparkSQL, ANSI SQL, LangChain, various vector datastores...the list goes on and on. Feel free to browse around my repos...you'll find some interesting examples. 

Feel free to reach out to me via my email...it's this account name at gmail.com.  Also feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
