Welcome to my main Github page.  I'm Dave Sisk, and I've been a data and database professional for over 20 years now. I've worked with every common database platform
at least once (some more), and with a few you've probably never heard of.  Open-source PostgreSQL is one of my favorites, and I'm a big supporter of this new breed of
columnar analytics databases on the market, including Snowflake (you'll find a tool in one of my repos for deactiving users quickly), Vertica, and open-source 
Clickhouse. I've worked about equally with OLTP systems and Data Warehousing/BI/Analytics systems over the years, including Big Data analytics.

In mid-2022, I completed a Master's degree in Data Science with the intent of pivoting my focus more toward data science, machine learning, and analytics in 
general. Over time I'll add repos for research I'm doing into fraud and anomaly detection, plus likely some work with a few of the machine learning technologies 
that scale well enough to accomodate big data....look for some future repos with content around Apache MADlib, Spark, PostgresML, and possibly others.

Feel free to reach out to me via my email...it's this account name at gmail.com.
